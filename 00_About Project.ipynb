Precise carbon readings allow researchers and governments to understand the sources and patterns of carbon mass output.There are extensive systems in place to monitor carbon emissions on the ground.\n",

    "- To understand the relationships between atmospheric parameters and pollution levels, as well as to identify potential spatial and temporal trends in pollution data.\n",
